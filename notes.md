# Project Notes #

* Need to have another board to show where the player has guessed
* Need to have the Block be it's own component
  * Each Block needs a component ID so It can be picked out from the Board (example A1)
  * Passed down from the Board component
* Animation to show the bomb coming down
  * change of the dot size bigger to smaller
  * tiles shake under when the boat is struck
